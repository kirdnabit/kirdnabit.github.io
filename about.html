                My name is Andrik and I'm currently in my junior year of my BSIT at KSU. I currently work at Home Depot where I have learned 
                the importance of people skills and problem solving. I feel this job has helped me in understanding the need to be flexible 
                because every person has their own individual questions/projects that may be unique to them.

                I have an interest in pursuing a career as data analyst. As of right now, I have completed a group project in my database
                class where we were tasked with creating tables using DDL, modified the tables using DML, and created queries for finding data using DQL. We also 
                practiced good normalization habits to ensure that our queries matched industry standards. I plan on expanding my skills by learning about built-in 
                Python libraries to manage bigger datasets, as well as utilizing visualization tools such as Tableau.

                For this project, we were tasked with creating a dynamic website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS. For the content presented on the website, we were 
                allowed to choose a topic of our liking to research and format it employing good web development standards such as accessibility and transparency.
                I chose to research the rock subgenre of Shoegaze. This music subgenre is a personal favorite of mine due to my bias for experimentation, allowing for 
                the creation of unique, and sometimes odd, musical soundscapes.
