            <h1>Proto-Gaze</h1>
            <div id="proto-gaze">
                <p>The roots of shoegaze can be traced as far back as the 1960s, with artists who embraced noisy experimentation and unconventional production techniques. The Velvet Underground, particularly on 
                   <i>White Light/White Heat</i>, helped establish a foundation built on distortion and droning guitars. Another major influence came from The Byrds’ 1966 album <i>Fifth Dimension</i>, which 
                   was frequently cited by later shoegaze pioneers such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive. The hypnotic drone heard on tracks like <i>Eight Miles High</i> clearly reflects this influence. 
                   Phil Spector’s development of the Wall of Sound further shaped the genre’s identity, as its dense layering of instruments inspired shoegaze’s immersive and atmospheric soundscapes. Considered an 
                   early proto-shoegaze album, The Cure’s 1982 release <i>Pornography</i> combined dark lyricism with swirling effects, establishing many of the aesthetic and sonic qualities that would later define 
                   the genre. This approach was expanded upon in 1985 when The Jesus and Mary Chain released <i>Psychocandy</i>, which made heavy use of distortion-laden drones that became a hallmark of shoegaze.</p>

                <p> Widely regarded as the most influential band within the genre, My Bloody Valentine played a pivotal role in shaping shoegaze as it is known today. Their 1991 album <i>Loveless</i> 
                    encapsulated nearly every defining characteristic of the genre, including heavily distorted guitars, vocals drenched in reverb and chorus, and dense layers of sound inspired by the Wall of Sound 
                    technique. The band’s live performances also contributed to the naming of the genre itself, as British music critics noted the musicians’ tendency to stare at the floor during shows—an action 
                    that was more reflective of their focus on effects pedals than stage presence. Alongside My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive emerged as another cornerstone of shoegaze, further refining the genre’s 
                    sound with their 1993 album <i>Souvlaki</i>, which emphasized ethereal textures and emotionally charged lyrics. Ride also played an essential role in the genre’s development, as their album 
                    <i>Going Blank Again</i> introduced more melodic and pop-influenced elements, helping to diversify shoegaze’s musical range.

                <p>Following its initial decline in the mid-to-late 1990s, shoegaze saw a resurgence throughout the 2010s and early 2020s, often referred to as the shoegaze revival. While modern artists 
                   continue to draw heavily from the genre’s original pioneers, they have expanded its sound by blending influences from punk, emo, slowcore, electronic music, and lo-fi aesthetics. 
                   Advances in digital recording technology have allowed musicians to recreate dense, layered soundscapes from home studios, giving rise to greater experimentation and accessibility within 
                   the genre. Online platforms such as Bandcamp and streaming services further contributed to this revival by enabling niche communities to form around the genre. Contemporary acts like 
                   They Are Gutting a Body of Water exemplify this modern evolution by maintaining shoegaze’s signature wall of sound while incorporating distorted textures, glitch effects, and 
                   emotionally introspective themes that resonate with newer audiences.
