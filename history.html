            <h1>Proto-Gaze</h1>
            <div id="proto-gaze">
                <p>The roots of shoegaze can be traced as far back as the 1960's. Artists like The Velvet Underground, with their proto-punk approach of noisy experimentation
                on <i> White Light/White Heat</i>, helped instill a love of loud, distorted guitars. The Byrds' 1666 <i> Fifth Dimension</i> was constantly cited as a major
                influence on shoegaze pioneers such as MBV, Ride, and Slowdive. It's pretty evident why when listening to songs like<i> Eight Miles High</i> due to the 
                hypnotic drone used throughout the song. Possibly the most notable characteristic of Shoegaze, Phil Spector's development of the Wall Of Sound greatly 
                influenced the genre's tendencies to create a thick layer of effects and volume, adding to its dreamy soundscape.
                    Considered to be an early example of proto-shoegaze, The Cure's 1982 <i>Pornography</i> helped set the precedent for a lot of shoegaze aesthetics. 
                Dark and gloomy lyrics combined with dreamy swirling effects throughtout the album, it makes sense why this album was important for the development of Shoegaze.
                In 1985, The Jesus and Mary Chain's <i>Psychocandy</i> made use of the loud distortion drones Shoegaze was known for.</p>

                <p>Generally considered to be the most influential band in the genre, My Bloody Valentine helped establish a genre loved by critics and music lovers alike. Their 
                    1991 album <i>Loveless</i> has everything that became essential to Shoegaze. Loud, distored guitars, vocals drenched in reverb and chorus mixed to the point of 
                    being unitelligble, the ubiquitous guitar that sounds like a vaccuum cleaner, all encapsulated in reverb to create dense layers akin to the Wall of Sound. Their 
                    live shows were what helped to give the genre its name. British music critics coined the term as reference to the fact that they, alongside other Shoegaze bands,
                    spent a majority of the shows staring at their feet. In reality, the musicians on stage were more concerned with their effects pedals, which where placed on the 
                    ground. Shoegaze companions Slowdive are a must know for any interested pair of ears. Another giant of the genre, Slowdive helped to cement the sound of Shoegaze 
                    with <i> Souvlaki</i>, an album filled with etheral backdrops accompanied by emotional lyrics. Alongside MBV and Slowdive, Ride was essential to the development
                    of the genre. With <i> Going Blank Again</i>, they helped pushed Shoegaze towards more diverse sounds and making use of pop-esque melodies.
